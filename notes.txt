should home, about, projects feed and blog feed be on same page??
sidebar would direct to page anchor, jQ to change highlight based on view height to 'scroll with you'
projects and blog lead to larger projects/blog page, where front page feed is just the most recent

WOULD BE NICE:
header and footer in compositor
give titles decent names eg 'Alyssa's Projects'
.md for posts

SIDEBAR:
highlight current page
add toggle button of small folder tab in top left

TEMPLATES:
change columns to fit
    HOME:
    combine with about? if scrolling, parallax?

PROJECTS:
    project feed, md or json??
BLOG: same thing



NEEDS DOING:

MODELS:

COLLECTIONS:
